# Rudimentary-Neural-Network
This project builds a neural network from scratch using Python &amp; NumPy, aiming to understand machine learning algorithms deeply. Core components like weighted sums, activation functions, and backpropagation were implemented. Tested on XOR and a synthetic dataset, it achieved high accuracy, demonstrating its learning and generalization capabilities
